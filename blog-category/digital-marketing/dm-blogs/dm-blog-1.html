                <p class="font-xvs font-thin black">Google is becoming an important element of how users explore services and products in their area as people
                    rely increasingly heavily on it to get answers to their most immediate issues. Almost billions of people
                    search for things on Google every day, from local coffee shops to celebrity news and so on. This is why it
                    is important to establish a position in Google my business to increase audience reach and sales to your
                    business.
                    Google Business Profile is a free Google business listing. It allows you to provide information and
                    photographs about your company, such as its location, services, and products. Having a profile in Google My
                    Business aids in making your business more transparent and visible.
                    Google is estimated to receive 5.6 billion searches per day, of which a majority of the queries are related
                    to local intent. This indicates that the majority of the users are looking for businesses or places nearby
                    them.
                    Google Business Profile is solely accessible to businesses that have consumer contact. This includes both
                    physical enterprises and firms that provide services via meeting with customers in various locations.
                    Creating this free account is an excellent method to boost your presence across Google services. Your Google
                    Business Profile information may display in Google Search, Maps, and Shopping.
                    Given below are the top few methods how Google my business could help your small business scale up.
                </p>
                <h4 class="font-s font-bold black">Control business information and increase engagement</h4>
                <p class="font-xvs font-thin black">Your Google My Company page allows you to manage and modify your contact information, business hours, and
                    other important information as needed. Google My Business accounts offer numerous chances for interaction.
                    With a single tap or click, potential clients can visit your website or reach you. Even more useful is the
                    ability to schedule a table or an appointment immediately from your ad.</p>
                <h4 class="font-s font-bold black">Boost sales</h4>
                <p class="font-xvs font-thin black">While a quick search is useful for narrowing down alternatives, 86% of users use Google Maps to find
                    businesses nearby. When clients find it more convenient to come to your business if you're close by, you're
                    more likely to make that transaction.
                    Furthermore, shoppers who discover a business through their Google My Business listing are up to 50% more
                    inclined to purchase. Simply by setting up a Google My Business page and finishing the verification
                    requirements, your store location will begin to appear in Maps for local searches.

                <h4 class="font-s font-bold black">Build trust with clients</h4>
                <p class="font-xvs font-thin black">The problem clients mostly face in the digital world is building trust with a brand or business confident
                    enough to purchase a product or service. There is a way for a business owner for you to tackle this issue
                    and that is to provide the location of your business on Google My Business so your clients can verify and
                    purchase from you.
                    According to a survey conducted by Google, it was found out that clients are 3 x more probable to buy a
                    product or service if the brand shows up on Google search.
                    This is due, in part, to the well-established credibility of the Google My Business verification procedure.
                    Because it is well recognized that businesses must follow specified measures to appear in a search
                    algorithm, Google is a trusted environment on which people can rely.

                <h4 class="font-s font-bold black">Rank better in Google Searches</h4>
                <p class="font-xvs font-thin black">Google, like the rest of us, has a job to do. While it may appear that Google is working against you at
                    times, Google wants to notify customers about your company because it needs to deliver valuable information
                    to searchers. The more information Google has about your company, the higher it will rank you in search
                    engine and Maps results.<br>
                    How can you persuade Google to favor your company more? By providing reliable, consistent, and up-to-date
                    information. Your Google My Business profile is the greatest place to provide Google with this information
                    so that it can successfully meet the search needs of your customers.</p>
                <h4 class="font-s font-bold black">Increase Engagement </h4>

                    customers. This is possible as your potential clients can access your website or call within a touch. They
                    can directly book or reserve a table or take an appointment by going through your listed business.</p>
